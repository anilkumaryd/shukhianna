Other cookies collect information about how Users use the Application. Finally, other cookies are used to collect information about your perceived interest in our products or services so that we can arrange for advertisements regarding these products or services to display on the Application or other sites that you visit on the Internet. This way, when you visit other sites that display advertisements, the advertisements that you see are more relevant to you.<br>These cookies are not linked to any contact information or identifying information, thus cookies do not tell us who you are, but they may identify your Device.<br>If you have any other questions about cookies and other technologies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ or http://networkadvertising.org/ or contact us as indicated in the How to contact us section.<br>How We Use the Information We Collect<br>For Marketing and Business Development<br>When not precluded from doing so, we may use the Information we have received from you or about you to solicit feedback from you, including through surveys or to send you marketing communications and promotional material about other products and services.
